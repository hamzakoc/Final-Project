                <p>Canada Welcome Centre is a voluntary organization which is performing its activities under the roof of Northern Lights Relief Foundation.

Its main mission is to help newcomers to get adapted to their new living environment by giving them reliable and practical information. Besides, specific services we will provide will help newcomers benefit from our welcome center as a resource for their needs.

Our vision is growing our Canadian communities by helping them from scratch. Today’s newcomers will become the settled members of our society. We need to build up our society by helping each other. We believe that helping when needed, when you first came to this country will never be forgotten.

We are here to help all newcomers…

We encourage our friends to help us in this mission and vision by contributing in several ways; donations, participating activities as volunteers and informing others about our activities.</p>
